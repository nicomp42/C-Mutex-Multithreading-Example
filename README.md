# C-Mutex-Multithreading-Example
John and Mary trying to make bank deposits. These two folks are having a tough time.</br>
There is one file here. There is no project for an IDE to consume. </br>
Just compile with gcc: </br>
gcc -Wall johnAndMary.c -l pthread  </br>
Then run the executable: </br>
./a.out </br>
It's fun for the entire family!</br>
